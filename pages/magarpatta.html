        <div class="history-info">Situated in Magarpatta, Cybercity is one of the oldest and first-ever IT parks and township in Pune. Spread over a whopping 430 acres, Cybercity is a swanky glass tower IT park located inside Magarpatta City. The fully facilitated, advanced commercial building has an infrastructure to suit the needs of any IT company in an uncompromised manner with world-class facilities to enable high quality IT and ITES delivery. They have flexible office spaces so making switches based on your organisation structure is a cakewalk. The good part is you can always choose to stay in Magarpatta itself as the huge township has schools, malls, residences and a lot more. This would make your crazy deadlines and work-life easy. Currently, Cybercity has offices of brands like Qualitas IT Pvt Ltd, Maverick IT, Sybase An SAP Company, Accenture, CapGemini, Red Hat India Private Limited, HCL Technologies Limited and many more.
