            EON IT Park in Kharadi is a collaborative space where multiple industries work together, whereas Hinjewadi
            majorly focuses on the IT industry. The emergence of IT started at Hinjewadi and today we can see it
            flourishing in different areas of Pune, becoming a major IT Hub in the nation.
            An important node of Pune's eastern IT corridor, EON Free Zone offers enriched business spaces with
            world-class design, robust infrastructure and superior support services. The north wing of E-Park is owned
            by Sunil Bharti Mittal-led telecom operator Bharti Airte.
            EON Free Zone is the epicentre of a growth-driven future that contributes to the dynamics of free- market
            democracy. A significant node and the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Pune is located in Kharadi and
            spans a total area of ~ 6.2 million sq.
