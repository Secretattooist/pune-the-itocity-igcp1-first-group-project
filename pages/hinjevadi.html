            Earlier, Hinjawadi was a village until the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park. Today, it is one
            of the epicenters of IT industry in India. To enhance the overall planning and development of Hinjawadi
            area, it was brought under the jurisdiction of PMRDA. Initially, the State Government was reluctant on the
            demands to bring the Hinjawadi under the jurisdiction of either PMC or PCMC as this area needed special
            attention. Currently, the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park is divided into three major phases with further phases
            planned. Eventually, the Hinjawadi Industries Association (HIA) was formed to provide a joint forum to all
            stakeholders based out of Hinjawadi and nearby places.

            Hinjawadi is a proposed hub for integrated townships in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The new Special Township Policy
            Act of the Maharashtra government has laid down an integrated approach to the development of townships to
            de-congest Pune Municipal Corporation areas and encourage new settlements in its periphery though higher FSI
            (floor space index) than what is normally allowed in the municipal limits.
