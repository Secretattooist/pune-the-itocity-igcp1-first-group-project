            Earlier, Hinjawadi was a village until the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park. Today, it is one of the epicenters of IT industry in India. To enhance the overall planning and development of Hinjawadi area, it was brought under the jurisdiction of PMRDA. Initially, the State Government was reluctant on the demands to bring the Hinjawadi under the jurisdiction of either PMC or PCMC as this area needed special attention. Currently, the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park is divided into three major phases with further phases planned. Eventually, the Hinjawadi Industries Association (HIA) was formed to provide a joint forum to all stakeholders based out of Hinjawadi and nearby places.

Hinjawadi is a proposed hub for integrated townships in Pimpri-Chinchwad.[5] The new Special Township Policy Act of the Maharashtra government has laid down an integrated approach to the development of townships to de-congest Pune Municipal Corporation areas and encourage new settlements in its periphery though higher FSI (floor space index) than what is normally allowed in the municipal limits.
